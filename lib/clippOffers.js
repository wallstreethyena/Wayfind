// lib/clippOffers.js — the Clipp market registry: WHICH clipp.com pages we are
// willing to send a user to, and the evidence that each one is real.
//
// WHY A REGISTRY AND NOT A URL TEMPLATE
// clipp.com is behind Akamai and 403s every non-browser fetcher — pages,
// robots.txt and sitemap.xml alike. So nothing in CI, no cron, and no health
// probe can ever tell us whether a clipp.com page exists: a 403 is returned for
// the real Sarasota page and for a made-up one identically. A template like
// `/states/fl/cities/${slug}` would therefore mint confident links to pages
// nobody has ever loaded, and the first evidence of a bad one would be a user
// landing on an error page with our affiliate tracking attached.
//
// So membership in this list IS the claim, and every row carries the browser
// verification that backs it. Adding a market means opening it in a real browser
// and recording what was on the page — not editing a slug.
//
// THE SHAPE MISTAKE THIS LIST EXISTS TO PREVENT
// The path shape /local-coupons/<st>/<city> looks right and was in the original
// hand-off notes. It renders Clipp's own "Sorry, something went wrong!" page.
// The shape that actually serves inventory is /states/<st>/cities/<city>.
// Both were confirmed in a browser on 2026-07-29.
//
// REGISTRY RULE (WORK_ORDER_DEALS_SHARECARDS.md §2): every deal that enters code
// also gets a row in the off-repo project registry (claude/wayfind-deals-registry.md)
// with a scheduled expiry robot. The coupon cards auto-hide on `expires`; the
// robots clean up the data. A row here is NOT a substitute for that.
import { clippDeepLink, isClippDest } from "./deals.js";

// One row per verified market. `verified` is evidence, not decoration:
//   on        — the date a human/browser actually loaded the page
//   dealsSeen — how many offers were on it (0 would mean "exists but is empty",
//               which is NOT shippable — we would be sending users to a blank)
//   sample    — merchants seen on the page, so a future audit can tell
//               "inventory rotated" apart from "the page broke"
