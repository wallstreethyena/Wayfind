// scripts/lib/ownerApproval.mjs — what counts as OWNER APPROVAL for an edit to
// an owner-only file, decided from GitHub-authenticated evidence only.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-23). check-doc-ownership used to grant approval when
// a commit's author NAME was "Gabriel Pereira". Commit author and committer are
// plain text that anyone can set (`git commit --author=...`,
// GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=...), so any lane could satisfy the check by typing the
// owner's name. PR #1478 (the CLAUDE.md cleanup) hit the check and the only
// way through was to impersonate the owner, which is not approval at all.
//
// WHAT IS TRUSTED NOW. A pull-request comment whose author is an owner LOGIN
// (resolved by GitHub from the authenticated account that posted it, never
// from git metadata) with a line
//
//     /owner-approve <the full 40-character head commit sha>
//
// that names the PR's CURRENT head commit. The full sha, not a prefix: a short
// prefix can be matched by grinding a different commit, a full SHA-1 cannot. A new push changes the head, so an
// old approval stops matching: the owner approves exact bytes, not a branch.
// Only GitHub Actions can read that evidence (the "guards" check and the
// "owner-approval" check, which applies the BASE branch's copy of this file);
// a local run can never grant approval.
//
// Pure module: no environment, filesystem, network or git access. The caller
// (scripts/check-doc-ownership.mjs) gathers evidence and passes it in, so every
// rule here is executable in hermetic tests.

// Accounts allowed to approve: the login (compared case-insensitively, as GitHub
// does) AND the numeric account id, which never changes, so a renamed or released
// login that someone else registers later cannot approve.

// Owner-only paths: rule-defining documents, plus the pieces that enforce this
